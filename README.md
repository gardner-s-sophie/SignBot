# SignBot
Created as part of sheHacks 2017 Hackackthon, this chatbot is a prototype of how we could use LUIS, Microsoft's machine learning-based service, to turn natural language speech into Australian Sign Language (ASL). The chatbot then uses this translation to send the user a video depicting how that message would look and sound in sign language. This could be used to teach people ASL in a more fun, intutative way or help speakers communicate with deaf people in real life by learning how to sign their message rather than just typing it out.
