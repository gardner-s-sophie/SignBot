# SignBot
This application was created in 24 hours as part of the 2017 sheHacks Hackackthon. üèÜ Winner of the **Best Machine Learning and API Integration** prize.


The chatbot is a prototype of how LUIS, Microsoft's machine learning-based service, can be used to turn natural language speech into Australian Sign Language (ASL). The chatbot then uses this translation to call and send to users a video depicting how that message would look in sign language. Natural language is far more complex than the ASL vocabulary 


This chatbot could have many different applicaitons in the future including:
* To teach people ASL in a more intutative and engaging way. 
* Help people in the hearing community communicate with deaf people in real life by learning how to sign their message rather than typing it out. This allows deaf and hearing people to have more natural, engaging and inclusive conversations, breaking down some of the barriers that exist between the two communities by fostering a mutual understanding. 
* Help people from different countries communicate using sign launguage. Sign language is less universal than spoken languages such as English and there are different langauges even amoung different English-speaking countries. There are over 13 different unique sign language families and countries such as American and England have completely different langauges. This application could help break down these bounaries by translating signs.
